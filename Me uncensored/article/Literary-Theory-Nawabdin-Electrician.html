            <h2>Summary </h2>
<p>
The story revolves around Nawabdin, an electrician working for a wealthy landowner, K.K. Harouni. Nawabdin's expertise in manipulating electric meters to cheat the company makes him indispensable to Harouni. Despite being the only servant to the wealthy patron, Nawabdin struggles to escape poverty. His life takes a positive turn when he acquires a motorcycle, improving his work efficiency and social status in the village. However, this change attracts a desperate robber who attempts to steal his motorcycle, leading to a violent confrontation. Although Nawabdin survives, he refuses to forgive the thief, proud of saving his motorcycle and securing his family's financial stability.
</p>
<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
Published in The New Yorker in 2007, "Nawabdin Electrician" is the first story in Daniyal Mueenuddin's collection "Other Rooms, Other Wonders," which comprises a total of eight interconnected short stories dealing with different aspects of Pakistani society, with the fictional K.K. Harouni serving as a constant presence. Set in rural Pakistan, this story delves into the lives of ordinary Pakistanis, shedding light on the struggles of the working class and offering social commentary on the country's socio-economic landscape. This essay aims to analyse the text through a Marxist perspective, examining how themes, symbols, and characters align with this approach.
 </p>
<h2>Marxist approach to capitalism: an introduction </h2>
<p> Before delving into the text analysis, it is essential to define the Marxist approach to capitalism and provide a foundational understanding for readers. 
</p>
<h3>Capitalism </h3>
<p>Capitalist society consists of two main classes: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie control the means of production (e.g. factories, warehouses, materials, etc.) and the proletariat transforms raw commodities into goods that have market value. The capitalist system prioritises maximising profits for the bourgeoisie which means getting the most possible work out of the proletariat in the least possible wages. The bourgeoisie wield power through social institutions including government, media, academia, and organised religion as weapons against the proletariat to maintain their economic privilege. </p>
<p>The proletariat, lacking ownership of production means, are vulnerable to exploitation in the capitalist economy. This power imbalance between the two concludes in the extreme alienation of the classes, since workers have little personal stake in the process of production and ultimately become resentful towards the bourgeoisie (for whom the value of the proletariat is purely economical). </p>
<p> This is where Marxism comes into play.</p>
<h3>Marxism </h3>
<p>The philosophy of Marxism developed by Karl Marx, predicts that the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat will lead to a communist revolution: where the working class would rebel against the bourgeoisie, taking control of the means of production and abolishing capitalism. Communism, on the other hand, is a system of government based on marxist principles, advocating for collective ownership of production means to eliminate capitalism and address worker exploitation.</p>
<p>Lastly, the labor theory of value (LTV) is an economic concept, developed by classical economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo, which defines the value of a product as equivalent to the amount of labor required to produce it. Marx later expanded on the theory positing that the value created by workers exceeds their wages, with the surplus value appropriated by the bourgeoisie, perpetuating exploitation. </p>
<h2>Status quo presented in the text </h2>
<p>
With definitions set, the status quo portrayed within the text is typically capitalistic: divided between the wealthy landowner Harouni (representing the bourgeoisie) and Nawabdin (symbolising the proletariat), who serves him. Harouni's power allows him to subjugate Nawabdin who struggles with poverty and relies on his job for survival. ("... the salary he received from K.K. Harouni for tending the tube wells would not even begin to suffice.") </p>
<p>
Harouni lives lavishly off of his "estate", which symbolises the entrenched power and wealth of the elite, in contrast to Nawabdin who spends all day looking after the estate before returning to his modest lodgings ("K. K. Harouni lived mostly in Lahore and rarely visited his farms"). Keeping the labor theory of value in mind, Nawabdin should be richer than Harouni precisely because he puts in more hours of work maintaining the estate. Hence, Mueenuddin masterfully depicts the wealth disparity propagated by capitalism.</p>
<p>
This cycle of subjugation and exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie inevitably leads to the ethical and moral corruption of society. Nawabdin steals electricity by slowing down the meter of his clients in a condemnable act, but the reader's opinion of him surely softens after discovering his responsibility of marrying off eleven daughters, while sustaining a wife and a son. Nawabdin's act of stealing electricity reflects the proletariat's response to economic necessity created by capitalism. </p>
<p>
From a broader lens, in response to this economic necessity, the working class exploits back usually in the form of illegal activity. The motorcycle serves as a symbol of improved status, showcasing how the capitalist system manipulates masses to associate capital with progress ("The motorcycle increased his status, gave him weight, so that people began calling him Uncle..."). The climactic robbery not only underscores the precarious nature of economic security when it comes to the proletariat, but also depicts that the exploitation by the working class in response to lack of sustenance is hazardous to the working class itself. This cycle of continuous exploitation creates chaos and unrest in society, leading to its moral degradation. </p>
<p>
The last stage in the marxist approach to capitalism is the imminent alienation between the two classes. Harouni is cold and indifferent to the struggles of Nawabdin ("He didn’t particularly care one way or the other, except that it touched on his comfort— a matter of great interest to him"). On the other hand, Nawabdin uses his master into buying him a motorcycle ("Nawab received a brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even managed to extract an allowance for gasoline"). Their relationship lacks genuine human connection and turns out to be purely economical, representing the alienation amongst the two classes. </p>
<p>
Nawabdin's twelve children are a stark contrast to Harouni's sole existence: portraying the vast disparity of wealth distribution in a typical Pakistani capitalist society where the majority is drowning in poverty, while the minority float in wealth. At a point, Mueenuddin references the seventies: "The farm lay strung along a narrow and pitted farm-to- market road, built in the nineteen-seventies, when Harouni still had influence in the Islamabad bureaucracy". The author may have been reminiscing about a period in Pakistan's history (circa 1968) where twenty two industrial family groups had come to dominate the economic and financial life in the country, controlling about two-thirds of its industrial assets, eighty percent of banking and seventy-nine percent of insurance. Eliminating all chances of circumstance, it is evident that the author references to that event as part of his subtle critique of capitalism.</p>
<p>
Mueenuddin, well versed in leading the reader to a particular conclusion, only to end up diverging to a different path altogether, employs similar tactics in this text. He spends majority of the prose painting a grey character, one who commits crime in the day, and putters off home on his motorcycle to enjoy the reaps of his criminal harvests at night. The reader, if not sympathetic, is surely empathetic to his efforts to secure a financial future for his family, so the question is: would the unorthodox electrician himself be just as merciful to another devoted family man, who comes to render crimes that may be only a little more horrendous, as the reader is to him? </p>
<p>
Clearly not. Despite the robber being on the verge of death pleading his emotive case to the electrician ("Maybe you’re a poor man, but I’m much poorer than you. My mother is old and blind, in the slums outside Multan"), Nawabdin refuses to overlook his actions. Nawabdin's refusal to forgive the robber mirrors the power dynamics between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, highlighting the unforgiving nature of those in positions of power. </p>
<p>
Consumerism is depicted through Nawabdin's protection of his motorcycle over a human life ("He thought of the motorcycle, saved, and the glory of saving it"), illustrating the allure of consumer goods and the promise of a better life attached to their acquisition: the hallmark of a capitalist society. The robber's gunning down of Nawabdin depicts the risks associated with material aspirations, the would-be-thief also representing the desperation and moral compromises forced upon the impoverished, his actions being a direct consequence of the same economic system that keeps Nawabdin in servitude. </p>
<p>
Even though Nawabdin works as an electrician, his life's work bringing light to home, his personal life remains mired in darkness. A paradox indeed, not to mention the telltale sign of capitalism where if one does not own the means of production, skills are rendered redundant. </p>
<p>
Mueenuddin also introduces his well known analogy game by depicting Nawabdin's life as a constant battle against poverty. During one moment in the story, Nawabdin "looked with satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of a warrior going out to do battle". The mere act of going out to earn a wage is symbolised as going out into the battlefield, showcasing the harsh working and financial conditions of the proletariat in capitalist Pakistan.</p>
<p>
 It may also be an attempt by the writer to influence the reader to view the titular character in perhaps a different light, clearly evident by "Another man might have thrown up his hands—but not Nawabdin". It is as vexing as it is satisfying to see this multi-layered electrician view himself as a "proud criminal" who struggles to barely be afloat amid the destructive financial turmoil in the country. The battlefield analogy is further reiterated by the end with "Six shots, six coins thrown down, six chances, and not one of them had killed him, not Nawabdin Electrician." </p>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>At the beginning of the story, Nawabdin's plight seems to be an individual struggle for betterment, but with the inculcation of the robbery, it becomes clear that his struggle is emblematic of the broader exploitation and alienation inherent in capitalist societies. Nawabdin's experiences symbolise the broader struggles faced by the working class in capitalist societies, emphasising the dehumanising effects of economic disparity. Thus, Mueenuddin's narrative effectively conveys the complexities of capitalism and its impact on individuals within Pakistani society. </p>
