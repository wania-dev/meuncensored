    <p>A lot of people asked me via my private Instagram stories the question: how do I even read a book?</p>
    <p>Sounds pretty basic, right?</p>
    <p>No, not really.</p>
    <p>Here's a little story:</p>

    <p>I was in my O'level Literature class when my teacher asked the very same question. Some of us instantly went down pondering the gazillion ways the answer we've automatically been conditioned to accept without an ounce of contemplation can be stupidly naive (a practice usually learned in Eng Lit). For others the answer was obvious: kitab uthao aur pardhna shuru kardo. So the fact that people are asking a question this basic is quite surprising. But, I ain't complaining.</p>

    <p>That day we were assigned to watch a video by Jared Henderson titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laXcJyx9xCc&pp=ygUoaG93IHRvIGdldCB0aGUgbW9zdCBvdXQgb2YgYSBib29rICBqYXJlZA%3D%3D">How to Read (and Understand) Hard Books</a>" based on Mortimer Adler and CVD's book "How to Read a Book." This assignment was followed by an in-depth discussion that changed the way I read books.</p>

    <p>According to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laXcJyx9xCc&pp=ygUoaG93IHRvIGdldCB0aGUgbW9zdCBvdXQgb2YgYSBib29rICBqYXJlZA%3D%3D">How to Read a Book</a>", the authors state that there are essentially four layers of reading when analyzing a book - be it fiction or nonfiction.</p>

    <p>To provide an overview, the first layer is practically elementary. It just ensures that you're able to read and understand written language - the most basic form of reading. The second layer is called inspectional reading. This is inherently a pre-reading stage where you do a quick overview of the text to answer this very simple question: what is this book about? Once you know what the author wants to say, this brings us to the third layer which answers the question: has the author succeeded in their goal?</p>

    <p><em>Have they effectively achieved what they set off to do?</em></p>

    <p>Why we read a book like this, why each stage is important, and how each stage is effectively done are questions the answers to which will be explored in this article.</p>

    <h2>Second Layer: Inspectional Reading</h2>

    <p>Have you ever felt the nagging passion to pick up a completely random book say on Politics in Ukraine? It's not that you give a shit about Ukraine ke haalaat, but your common sense was moved by the bookish aroma, and the texture of the wooden pulp of the paper. You recreate the aesthetics of reading a book - light a candle maybe, sit beside a window, or if you're chutiya enough, buy a brand new reading lamp kyunke stories aesthetic chahyein.</p>

    <p>Two pages into it, you start losing interest. A little regret starts creeping in.</p>

    <p>"Kis kutte ne kaata tha joh yeh kitaab leli?" is the average question that pops into the average mind. "I should've stuck to Colleen Hoover!"</p>

    <p>Now in this situation, it doesn't take a genius to realize that you shouldn't have picked that book up. The obvious reason is: that you didn't have any interest in what the book had to offer in the first place.</p>

    <p>The less obvious: even if you were intrigued by what you thought the book had to offer, you simply didn't know what that was. You saw the title, thought back to Ukraine and Russia, and how cool it would be to know what the hell is going on.</p>

    <p>Except that book wasn't even about that in the first place. It was about the general trend in Ukrainian history - their political nuances and the type of nitty-gritty you need research and context to understand. Yes, you heard me. Research in addition to the book itself.</p>

    <p>It's simple really. Not every book is made keeping absolute beginners in mind. Some require you to have a certain knowledge base to be able to make sense of the book.</p>

    <p>Now how do you know exactly what to research before starting a book?</p>

    <p>It's simple really (2).</p>

    <p>Start by asking this basic question: what is this book about?</p>

    <p>You don't have to read the entire book to determine that - that would be counter-intuitive. Instead, reading the backside waali blurb, looking at the table of contents, and reading online reviews is sufficient enough.</p>

    <p>Incase it's still not clear by the Ukraine waali example, let's sum up why this is particularly important.</p>

    <p>First of all aapka time waste na hou. Most of the time, whatever the hell the book is trying to teach you, or the messages it’s trying to convey, woh aapko samaj hi nahi ayega bcuz maybe you don’t have the required knowledge base to do that.</p>

    <p>So even if you've somehow gone through the book, you’ll have no idea WHY you’ve read it. And more importantly, you won’t know what to do with the knowledge you've gathered.</p>

    <p>"ISS INFO KA ACHAR DALUN?"</p>

    <p>Consequently, because of the bad experience you'd've had with it, you'll end up saying boring ya baqwas book thi, when the truth is you as a person weren't equipped with the prerequisites to understand what it was trying to do. I hate to break it but...</p>

    <p>You totally should've stuck with Colleen Hoover.</p>

    <p>Thori aur lambi karne ke liye I'll share another story.</p>

    <p>I've read "Songs of Blood and Sword" thrice.</p>

    <p>A full year ago I was making the transition to South Asian literature and compiled a list of books my associates said I should read. Goes without saying, SOBAS was part of it.</p>

    <p>I didn't know what it was even remotely about until I was through with the first few chapters. And needless to say, I barely made it through and once I was done (woh bhi formality poori karne k liye, samaj ghanta nahi aaya), the book was abandoned for months.</p>

    <p>Then I picked it up again. Some would say that I should've studied for my Math CAIE instead - but nobody tells me how to spend my time:)</p>

    <p>Previously, I was under the impression ke it's just a biography written by a daughter for her father: possibly a political stunt to paint his name in a positive light. Understand that at the time I had no concept of what happened among the Bhuttos, particularly Murtaza Bhutto (like upar upar ki knowledge k ilawa). So there was something the first read defnitely did.</p>

    <p>At least I found out what the book was about.</p>

    <p>It was much more intricate than just the privileged child of a well-known politician garnering sympathy for her family. The main purpose of the book was essentially to look at Pakistan ki political history from the perspective of wealth, power, and prestige. More specifically, what the author tried to achieve with her book was to look at her family history and untangle it from Pakistan ki political history. To understand what the Bhutto's (specifically her father) were APART from the role they played in shaping modern politics.</p>

    <p>Only when I read a couple more articles, and watched some documentaries did I not only feel confident enough to pick it up, but also equally intrigued. And that is what the author <strong>intends</strong> to do. Needless to point out, I have highlighted "intends" for reasons you will find out sooner.</p>

    <p>The point is, had I known what essentially the book was about to throw my way, I'd've closed it, chup se done my research, and THEN picked it up - would’ve saved me A LOT of time and frustration.</p>

    <p>Alas! The third stage!</p>

    <p>This is where the real work starts. Where you get to read the book.</p>

    <p>Now that you know exactly what the author is trying to pull off, in this stage you need to determine IF the author does effectively succeed. Remember, just because the author <strong>tries</strong> to convey a certain message, doesn't mean they necessarily achieve it.</p>
<p>An example.</p>

    <em style="font-size: 13px">
        "Oh! well did the tall stately girl of eighteen remember the tears shed with such wild passion of grief by the little girl of nine, as she hid her face under the bed-clothes in that first night; and how she was bidden not to cry by the nurse, because it would disturb Miss Edith; and how she had cried as bitterly, but more quietly, till her newly-seen, grand, pretty aunt had come softly upstairs with Mr. Hale to show him his little sleeping daughter. Then the little Margaret had hushed her sobs, and tried to lie quiet as if asleep, for fear of making her father unhappy by her grief, which she dared not express before her aunt, and which she rather thought it was wrong to feel at all after the long hoping, and planning, and contriving they had gone through at home..."
    </em>

    <p>This is a paragraph from Elizabeth Gaskell's "North and South" where the protagonist Margaret is recounting a childhood memory. It is evident that the author has tried to garner the reader's sympathy by using linear storytelling, but ends up achieving the opposite. She has explicitly stated Margaret's feelings rather than show her struggles through actions, dialogue, and relationships with other characters. The explicit mention of her hiding her grief diminishes the emotional subtlety of this scene. The statement that Margaret "rather thought it was wrong to feel at all" seems to impose a moral judgment on Margaret's emotions, which makes her character less relatable. Hence, even though it is evident that the author wants the reader to pity her, she ends up presenting her as wholly virtuous making it difficult for the reader to empathize with her.</p>

    <p>This is a very specific example of the author failing what they set out to do. In this stage, you need to keep the broader goals in mind. If the novel has a consistent theme of societal hypocrisy, how does a white person feeling guilty about helping a runaway slave contribute to that theme ("Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" for those lost)?</p>

    <p>You have the "What is the author saying?" determined in the second layer, it's time to find out:</p>

        <p>"Are they successful at saying it?"</p>
        <p>"How are they successful/unsuccessful?"</p>
        <p>"Why are they saying it at all?"</p>

    <p>In short, you need to be on the same page as the author. Go into the nitty-gritty. A way to do that is to X-ray the language they've used.</p>

    <p>For example, if they've made certain literary decisions toh why? If they've used a certain reference, toh why? What emotions, mood, or tone does the punctuation depict? Are sentences long or short, and why either?</p>

    <p>Asking these questions has not only helped me as a reader but as an A-level lit student in my essays.</p>

    <p>Now and only now that I’ve done ALL THIS SHIT can I form an opinion on kis tarhah ki read thi. Here I usually come to my conclusions as to whether whatever the author has said holds any reverence. This is the stage that enables you to criticize a piece of literature and be able to recommend it to others based on that analysis.</p>

    <p>This is the lengthiest process while reading a single book and is the reason why I go through books at a slower rate than others. Because I’m usually going through the same text 2 to 3 times kyunke mujhe cheezein choosne ki aadat hai. Yk how that juice ka dabba that u squeeze until all the juice is finished. Something like that with books as well.</p>

    <p>For the sake of completion, I'll briefly discuss the fourth and last layer. Synoptical reading is a fancy term for comparing the book to other works that fall under the same category, genre, or author. This is done to understand the discrepancy in perspectives, concepts, or arguments - ya phir to understand the difference in writing styles and what THAT might signify.</p>

    <p>This is mostly done taake whatever subject ur interested in apko uski aik comprehensive knowledge hou where you have actively considered various standpoints and generally have an idea ke industry mein kon kisse lardh raha hai, larai jhagre kis baat par hein - basically yeh woh log karate hein jinko aik subject mein phuppo banne ka shauq hou.</p>

    <p>This article is an extended version of the one I wrote on my private stories - though I did not know I could be this reckless with my grammar and punctuation. One thing I mentioned in my stories that I will leave out here is my MO. The very specific type of books I read under the South Asian Literature realm. Not because I think pehle hi bohat lambi hogayi hai and I should probably sleep (it's 3 AM) - but because I want to dedicate the 2000 word worth of baqwas to another article solely on that.</p>

    <p>Hence, in conclusion, this is how you read a book based on Mortimer Adlar and CVD's book "How to Read a Book" - and some personal anecdotes.</p>
