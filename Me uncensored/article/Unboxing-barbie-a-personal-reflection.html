        <article class="article">
            <p>I turned sixteen on the twenty-first of July this year.</p>
<p>Twenty-first of July was also the grandest cinematic event of the year.</p>
<p>So it’s the end of June, and a couple of friends wanted to do a meet-up, at the good old movies.</p>
<p>Barbie or Oppenheimer was the age-old debate that had ignited fervent discussions among us.</p>
<p>Inherently, my inclination leaned towards Oppenheimer, driven by an unrelenting obsession with the technological renaissance that unfolded during WWII, particularly centered around the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>Additionally, the appeal of Barbie had long faded to me since I turned twelve. In my eyes, the movie titled "Barbie" seemed destined to be yet another superficial, summer fling of a film—lacking substance, depth, and a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Other than my lack of preference for the film, I thought to myself that I might not be the perfect audience for Barbie since I wasn’t a <strong>girlie-girl</strong>!</p>
<p>As more time went on, I saw more press snippets like the Vogue interview where Director-writer Greta Gerwig drew a connection between Adam and Eve and Barbie and Ken - two plastic emissaries that, with each passing interaction, transformed from mere figurines into potential archetypes bearing significance.</p>
<p>With each new insight, my conviction wavered—perhaps there was more to Barbie than what met the eye.</p>
<p>In my research, I also discovered a peculiar phenomenon—an awakening of the “Bimbo Renaissance” on social media, especially TikTok, where #Bimbo continues to trend. The movement is a reclamation of the once derogatory “bimbo” label by content creators as they embrace unabashed femininity (instead of abandoning conventional femininity to succeed in a patriarchal world), forging a symbiotic relationship between girlish exuberance and the march towards gender parity.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the movie's debut coincided with this feminist resurrection, propelling the archetypal "bimbo" back into the limelight.</p>
<p>Nearing the release of the movie, I was enticed by the marketing and the anticipatory hype surrounding it. I was made to believe that the film would cause a seismic shift in my very perspective. The movie promised an immersion that would reshape my essence—perhaps an irrevocable transformation awaited me within the theatre’s embrace.</p>
<p>But as the credits rolled, I was left with an intricate tapestry of thoughts and emotions that I could not make sense of.</p>
<p>So when I walked out of the theatre, I felt the same old me.</p>
<p>True, some parts of the movie bore instantaneous impact, but the majority of it necessitated gestation, awaiting the hushed conversations between consciousness and slumber.</p>
<p>And now exactly two weeks hence, I feel the full effects of the movie. Its legacy courses through my veins—a transformation kindled not in an instant but through the gradual cascade of time.</p>
<p>I feel like a completely different person.</p>
<p>This delay reminded me that art's resonance is often measured by its ability to stir echoes within the labyrinth of introspection.</p>
<p>And so, over these cumulative weeks, I have spent researching the iconic and nostalgic Barbie doll, the various themes and messages of the first live-sized adaptation of the classic by the feminist luminary.</p>
<p>Yet, I’ve been battling some irrepressible thoughts of my own identity and womanhood. Questioning the facets of authenticity within me as I attempted to unwove myself to discern the threads spun by the uninvited hands of societal expectations.</p>
<p>In what ways did our deep-rooted patriarchal society impact me? What parts of me are authentic, and what are the direct consequences of the many uncomfortable aspects of womanhood in a society where it is not appreciated?</p>
<p>At what point did I stop being my true self?</p>
<p>While pondering over some of these questions, I realized that the backbone of my persona—my rebellious feminism—is the direct result of living under society’s expectations of me. God knows how many decisions I’ve made in retaliation, an act of defiance against these expectations, when what I should've done was stop and ask myself: what do I want?</p>
<h2>Barbieland and Perfectionism</h2>

<p>The film starts with a commentary on the first Barbie doll established in 1959 by the visionary American entrepreneur Ruth Handler, who named Barbie after her own daughter Barbara after realizing that kids enjoyed projecting youthful ambitions onto an adult paper doll rather than nursing conventional baby dolls.</p>

<p>Strikingly, Barbie’s inception was modeled after Tillie the Toiler, an audacious German comic strip character who was portrayed as an independent career woman.</p>

<p>Despite this innovative approach, Barbie was met with resistance from both male and female toy buyers who according to market research were uncomfortable with the doll’s mature nature.</p>

<p>Over time, however, Barbie underwent a metamorphosis that altered her identity into a realm hitherto uncharted. She was no longer a reflection of the current status of women in society, instead, she evolved into a woman of boundless aspirations, unshackled by societal norms.</p>

<p>She became the physical manifestation of a girl’s dreams.</p>

<p>Thus, the film traverses the origin story of the Barbie archetype—an inspiration designed to liberate young girls from the confinements of gender roles, urging them to be authentic manifestations of their liberated selves.</p>

<p>As a result, Barbie owned her own dreamhouse, her own car, and even a bank account (in a time when such autonomy was impossible for women without a male co-signer).</p>

<p>Hence, the movie segues into the iridescent Barbieland—a fantasy world where Barbies rule and the Kens are… well they're just Kens.</p>

<p>Be it a black president, the Nobel prize winners, or the supreme court, everything exudes girl-boss feminism while the Kens, in contrast, mostly ‘do beach’, are romantic counterparts of their respective Barbies, homeless, and devoid of individual roles.</p>

<p>Now a lot of people accuse the movie of being anti-men when in truth, the narrative does more than justice to its male characters by investing in them more dimension and inclusivity than a traditionally male-centered film would ever dare to offer its female characters.</p>

<p>Rather than succumbing to the temptation of marginalizing or demeaning the Kens, Barbieland takes a different route—it simply ignores them. A predicament that can be easily solved with a healthy amount of dialogue and understanding.</p>

<p>Unlike the patriarchy, the matriarchy of Barbieland does not sexualize or mistreat the Kens but rather allows them to explore their identity beyond their relationships with their Barbies. In the end, they come to embrace their self-sufficiency in the matriarchal world, standing as equals alongside the Barbies.</p>

<p>This narrative choice reverses the very stereotypes that have historically pigeonholed women in many ways, underscoring the need for empathy among all so we can be our empowered selves in a world that is diminishing and unfair to some than others.</p>

<p>The film follows the quintessential Barbie (Margot Robbie), who wakes up in her idyllic dreamhouse, gets up on her tip toes, takes a shower, has breakfast, then brushes her hair in a mirrorless vanity, before floating into the driving seat of her car.</p>

<p>Each frame beckons us to ponder: what about the static nature of Barbie makes her the perfect woman? What makes perfectionism so enticing? What does the pursuit of perfectionism entail?</p>
<h2>Barbie’s journey becomes a mirror…</h2>

<p>So I have been thinking about the mirrorless vanity for a while now. What does it mean? Why was it included in the narrative?</p>

<p>For those who might not be familiar, there's a scene where Barbie is brushing her hair in front of a mirror frame that doesn't actually have a mirror.</p>

<p>In this specific scene, the voice of Lizzo chimes in: 'If that was really a mirror, you'd see a perfect smile.'</p>

<p>Earlier we questioned: what makes a person pursue perfection so relentlessly? It all boils down to the merciless desire to be liked. To be loved for who we are. The promise of this kind of love is what compels a person to eliminate their ’flaws’ just so they can be deserving of it.</p>

<p>Imagine if we as humans learned the ability to be able to provide that kind of love to ourselves, we wouldn't constantly seek external affection. Our self-esteem wouldn't plummet if we didn't make a stellar first impression or couldn't play Badminton as well as our opponent (now I’m just self-projecting)</p>

<p>Hence the concept: Barbie doesn't need a mirror to affirm her perfection; it's woven into her existence.</p>

<p>The knowledge of her own perfection allows her to <strong>not</strong> seek external validation for it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the only reason Barbie steps into the real world is because that perfection has been threatened. Suddenly, Barbie faces bad breath, unruly hair, cellulite, burnt toast, irrepressible thoughts of death, embarrassment, and (gasps) flat feet!</p>

<p>Therefore, like a real woman, she moves worlds in order to hide the human features that she perceives as her ‘flaws’, just so she can retain her perfection.</p>

<p>The film mirrors the enigma of life itself, where the pursuit of perfection juxtaposes against the exhaustion of trying to attain it.</p>

<p>Stepping into the real world, Barbie faces a disconcerting reality: being admired for her beauty. Why does this bother her?</p>

<p>The male gaze shatters her self-worth, altering how she perceives herself. This is the moment the doll experiences womanhood.</p>

<p>Now all of a sudden she’s overwhelmed by a discomfort that’s hard to articulate. Just like countless other women, she is reduced to an object or a commodity especially in public spaces.</p>

<p>People focus on specific parts of her body, while her humanity, thoughts, emotions, and individuality are disregarded and she is treated as an object of others’ visual pleasure.</p>

<p>This is called objectification, and it takes a toll on self-esteem, body image, and overall well-being. Barbie, like many, finds herself sexualized by random guys on the beach, police officers, and even construction workers. Her worth gets tied to her desirability.</p>

<p>Moreover, she is catcalled, offered inappropriate comments, and even unwelcome touches (don’t worry, this Barbie knows how to throw a punch) further highlighting her objectification.</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic; border-left: 2px solid #000; padding-left: 10px;">
  <p>“Oh, there’s definitely an undertone of violence”<br>
  - Barbie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this exploration, the film delves into complex issues that resonate with real-life experiences of women. Barbie's journey becomes a mirror reflecting societal standards, the pursuit of perfection, and the yearning for authentic self-worth.</p>
<h2>Barbie in the real world</h2>

<h3>Is <em>Barbie</em> a bad role model that puts women at risk? Is Barbie hypocritical?</h3>

<p>My childhood has been nothing but a plethora of Barbies, dreamhouses, and the color pink, but when the turn came for my sister to play with them, I profusely protested.</p>

<p>Hypocrisy, some called it.</p>

<p>But I did so due to the potential negative effects these dolls might have on young minds.</p>

<p>From skewed body image ideals (and imminent and eventual dissatisfaction with their own bodies) to the promotion of white-washing and materialism, Barbie seemed problematic. The toy industry's glorification of domestic roles and the portrayal of women through Barbie's career choices didn't sit right.</p>

<p>Barbie also stigmatized aging as the twenty-something doll never lost her youthfulness, and demonstrated an unattainable perfection that was ultimately damaging for young girls.</p>

<p>It also was revealed that Barbie had been such a setback to the feminist movement, that it drew the ire of second-wave feminists in 1970, who marched for equality in NYC chanting the slogan ”I am not a Barbie Doll!”</p>

<p>In a documentary called <em>Tiny Shoulders: Rethinking Barbie</em>, Gloria Steinem (NY magazine columnist and leader of second-wave feminism in the US during the 1960s-70s) stated, “Barbie was pretty much everything the feminist movement was trying to escape from.”</p>

<p>For many, Barbie seemed like a product designed solely by the male gaze.</p>

<p>So my sister wasn't having any of it!</p>

<p>Until Gerwig came along.</p>

<p>As a fan of <em>Little Women</em> and <em>Ladybird</em>, I was intrigued by how a feminist filmmaker would tackle Barbie's legacy. A filmmaker whose past characters have been curious, transgressive, and rebellious against their limited environments.</p>

<p>Barbie’s venture into the real world, accompanied by Ken (who insisted on accompanying her since Barbie is a big part of Ken’s identity), brings a dose of reality for the delusional doll.</p>

<p>She finds out that not only did the Barbies fix nothing, instead, they seemed to amplify issues— consumerism, sexualized capitalism, and sexism.</p>

<p>She is met with extreme hostility from Sasha - the family of the girl who played with her - who brands Barbie as nothing more than a “professional bimbo” perpetuating unrealistic body proportions, and a privileged lifestyle that has plagued women for decades.</p>

<p>Notably, the concept of Barbie encouraged women to fulfill their ‘traditional roles’ and imposed career expectations on women — a paradoxical stance.</p>

<p>The hypocrisy of it!</p>

<p>Because somewhere along the lines, “girls can be anything” morphed into “women should be everything”.</p>

<p>Moreover, Barbie discovered that not only was the real world dominated by men, but even the decision-makers at Mattel were an all-male group who thought they qualified to determine what little girls like because they once had a woman CEO somewhere in the ’90s (or maybe two). These executives brainstormed pink and sparkle, imposing their vision on a diverse audience.</p>

<p>What struck me was the apparent blindness of these white men to the hypocrisy of their actions. Throughout the film, these executives also loomed, underlined by a subtle yet distinct gray undertone.</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic; border-left: 2px solid #000; padding-left: 10px;">
  <p>“I’m a man with no power, does that make me a woman?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Barbie’s existential crisis…</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the real world turns out to be a real bummer for our stereotypical Barbie.</p>

<p>Not only did her presence fail to catalyze any positive change, but women resented her.</p>

<p>Throughout her life, what she regarded as truth turned out to be the greatest fallacy.</p>

<p>She thought she knew all about what it is like to be a woman and achieve things, but her assumption of understanding womanhood and achievement was shattered when she experienced life as a woman herself.</p>

<p>Enhanced by Billie Eilish's poignant track "What Was I Made For?", the film is a visual manifestation of what it feels like to fake your way through life because of how we are told to feel and how we have to overcome it. It's a sentiment many of us, particularly women, intimately comprehend and empathise with.</p>
<h2>Ken-dom and the Patriarchy</h2>

<p>Amidst Barbie's transformative journey, Ken stumbles upon a bizarre concept – the patriarchy.</p>

<p>The realization dawns on Ken when he enters the real world alongside Barbie. While she grapples with objectification under the male gaze, he basks in admiration, feeling invincible for the first time.</p>

<p>Ken had spent his entire life in Barbie’s shadow. However, the real world exposed him to the potential for more. All he ever longed for was to be respected and valued, something the real world provided in abundance. Only if it wasn’t for a few technicalities like degrees and qualifications, Ken could rule the world.</p>

<p>This dialogue sums up Ken’s experience as he asks for a job (which he is not qualified for), from another man.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Is being a man not enough?”<br>
  ”Actually right now it’s quite the opposite”<br>
  ”You guys clearly aren’t doing patriarchy very well”<br>
  ”No, we’re doing it well, we just hide it better”<br>
  ”Oh”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the real world requires all kinds of paperwork, he decided to enlighten his fellow Kens in Barbieland about the patriarchy. His ulterior motive – to manipulate the Barbies into embracing the damsel-in-distress role, effectively erasing their independence as they respond to the Kens’ every whim and wish.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, the Barbies exist to be ogled at, serve beers, and nurture men’s fragile egos. The president serves drinks all the while the all-female supreme court is demoted to a cheerleading squad.</p>

<p>I can’t help but observe there is something about the kind of masculinity all the Kens come to embody that the film seems to mock. It’s called Performative Masculinity.</p>

<p>Performative Masculinity refers to men adopting stereotypical behaviors tied to traditional masculinity to conform to societal norms. Think dominance, emotional restraint, toughness, and independence – often performed more for approval than authenticity.</p>

<p>It is a show, a performance that men can put up to be considered “masculine” in order to fit in, gain social approval, or avoid ridicule.</p>

<p>By highlighting this brand of masculinity, the film underscores that such acts are transparent to women and others as it appears forced and insincere. Performative Masculinity, appearing contrived and hollow, hinders genuine connections and masks true identities. It also lays bare the fragility of traditional notions, encouraging us to see the artifice behind societal expectations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humans make things like patriarchy and Barbie just to deal with life.<br>
  - Ruth Handler (in the movie)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also can’t help but be reminded by this shift in Ken’s behavior of all the boys in our lives who gradually shed their authentic selves for Performative Masculinity. Suppressing emotions, flaunting (unnecessary):) physical strength, evading vulnerability, and chasing control in various contexts.</p>

<p>Hence, it exemplifies the idea that conventional masculinity is a learned behavior rather than a biological imperative. A behavior that can be unlearned with education and empathy.</p>

<p>Gerwig masterfully exposes the harm wrought by patriarchal norms on both genders. The takeaway: the real threat to women's rights isn't a plastic doll, but the entrenched patriarchy itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everybody hates women. Women hate women and men hate women. It’s the one thing everybody can agree on.”<br>
  - Sasha</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Masculinity vs Femininity</h3>

<p>Personally, I do not believe in the above terms.</p>

<p>Throughout history, society has imposed labels like "masculine" and "feminine" on certain activities and traits. Thus, forming an ideology that strays from the genuine psychology of men and women. These traits aren't innately wired into our brains based on gender, but are learned behaviors.</p>

<p>Abandoning these predefined concepts could potentially free us from society’s expectations. Then there would be no toxic or healthy masculinity or femininity; there would just be toxic or healthy human behaviors.</p>

<p>This liberation would allow us to embrace our genuine selves unburdened and undictated by societal reservations. As a girl, I could adore pink and be a body-builder, while a boy could openly express emotions without fear of being ridiculed.</p>

<p>The film, however, does not share my perspective. But it does something even more interesting by scrutinizing societal constructs with a critical eye, showcasing how patriarchy and matriarchy alike can stifle individuality and breed discontent.</p>

<p>In Barbieland, Kens initially have no purpose and the Barbies take on every single task of running society. By demonstrating both matriarchy and patriarchy through Barbieland, Ken-dom, and the real world, Gerwig astutely exposes that neither is ideal.</p>

<p>In this context, the real world aligns more with Ken-dom. Thus, investing effort in the success of women is crucial.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By giving voice to the effects on women under the patriarchy, you robbed it of its power.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Individuality and identity</h2>

<p>Within the core of the narrative lies an exploration of identity, both personal and collective.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that in the Barbie realm, even though all the female dolls that exist are Barbies and male dolls are Ken, each one possesses a unique essence.</p>

<p>But also, no one is different from the other in the sense that they all want the same things in life: be it perfection, unconditional love, or empowerment.</p>

<p>The film serves as a poignant reminder that our differences warrant compassion and empathy, fostering a celebration of individuality. Beneath our diverse exteriors lies a rich complexity shaped by experiences, desires, and struggles. Yet, our collective pursuit remains consistent – a life enriched by meaningful experiences. A unifying factor.</p>

<p>This theme is meticulously woven throughout the narrative, particularly as Barbie, Ken, and Gloria seek to understand themselves beyond perfection and the societal molds that confine and label them.</p>

<p>The film prompts its audience to introspect, urging us to scrutinize the roles we adopt and the masks we wear.</p>
<h2>An Ode to Womanhood</h2>

<p>The best thing about the film: through the character of Barbie, the multifaceted nature of womanhood is contemplated.</p>

<p>Gloria’s fatigue - expressed through her dissatisfaction with life, thoughts of death, and nostalgia over her daughter's childhood, all of which she projects onto Barbie - makes us recognize two opposing feelings at once. While it is empowering to be a woman who achieves great things, it is also… extremely exhausting.</p>

<p>In this moment in which the complexity of womanhood is acknowledged, the notion that women have an innate ability to ‘do it all’, i.e. have a career, a perfect family life, satisfying marriage and friendships, and promising experiences, is dispelled.</p>

<p>In the words of another entertainer - Shonda Rhymes - succeeding in one facet of life often means faltering in another. And that is life: finding a balance and accepting our limitations.</p>

<p>Recognizing that exhaustion is the first step Barbie and Gloria take in order to find their own humanity. This recognition is essential for their growth, whether it's Barbie's transformation into a human or Gloria's thought-provoking soliloquies on the double standards women face.</p>

<p>Another poignant takeaway surfaces: the futility of women attempting to change the men in their lives. Barbie's rejection of Ken's advances emphasizes that self-discovery is an individual journey men must undertake themselves. This narrative shift accentuates the fact that women aren't responsible for "fixing" men; rather, men must embark on their own paths of self-improvement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Maybe all the things that you thought made you, aren’t really you”<br>- Barbie to Ken (encouraging him to embark on a journey of self-discovery)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m also immensely glad for the movie to depict the different experiences of different generations of women with the Barbie doll. Sasha, a teenager, loathes Barbie and blames the plastic doll for being responsible for everything wrong in her world.</p>

<p>Unlike Sasha, for Gloria, a first-generation American, Barbie symbolized reassurance and inspiration. For her, Barbie did what she was meant to do: make her believe that she too can achieve anything she wanted to. This adds depth to Gloria's emotional investment when Barbie faces defeat in Barbieland's power struggle. The defeat is personal for Gloria.</p>

<p>Barbie's encounter with an elderly woman in the real world unveils a profound shift. Even though she’s young, ageless, and toned, she admires the wrinkles on the woman's face. That encounter not only de-stigmatizes ageing but also questions society's fixation on youthfulness.</p>

<p>After all, what does it mean to girls to age, when Barbie herself cannot?</p>

<p>This scene is especially enticing since it is proof that we desire what is unattainable. While the youthful Barbie has been in her twenties for seven decades (Mattel did hint that she is nineteen), she finds ageing appealing even though Barbie’s state must be envied by some. Or maybe it's just a matter of perspective. Either way, we can all agree it sheds light on the root of consumerism—a desire for the unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Ultimately, after undergoing a transformative journey filled with complex emotions, Barbie's perspective shifts. She transitions from aspiring to be the perfect figure to embracing her unique experiences as a woman.</p>

<p>Her desire to fully immerse herself in the tapestry of life, rather than embody an unattainable ideal, resonates as an empowering celebration of womanhood one can expect from a director like Gerwig who recognizes that while existing as a woman is a daunting journey laden with societal expectations, it is a beautiful celebration of humanity.</p>

<p>Barbie realizes this beauty, and transcends from a plastic doll into a human being embracing all the chaos life has to offer her. She desires to experience every sensation and emotion that a woman experiences. As unjust, sexist, and misogynistic as the world mostly is, Barbie no longer wants to be aspirational. She longs to be present and make decisions that would directly impact the real world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I want to do the imagining, not be the idea.”<br>- Barbie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the end of the film and in one of its most poignant and memorable moments, a montage of real-life women are featured who are living their everyday lives at different points in time.</p>

<p>At another point in the movie, Barbie is sitting on a bench in the real world and she sheds a tear. I am consumed by a deep sadness in that moment. The effect the real world has on the doll just representing a woman breaks her down. She is meant to be perfect, yet here she is broken like we usually are.</p>

<p>These moments collectively capture the essence of feeling empowered while navigating a world that often reduces our complexity to a mere appearance. And yet, within these intricacies, there is resilience, empathy, and connection—the very essence that makes being a woman so profoundly enriching.</p>

<p>What is womanhood?</p>

<p>The duality of existence—both its enchanting allure and its stark challenges.</p>

<p>And that's so beautiful.</p>

<p>Being a woman is beautiful.</p>

<p>A woman is beautiful.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/margot-robbie-barbie-summer-cover-2023-interview" target="_blank">Vogue</a> in May, Gerwig wonders that [Young girls] are “funny and brash and confident, and then they just—stop… How is this journey the same thing that a teenage girl feels? All of a sudden, she thinks, *Oh, I’m not good enough*.</p>

<p>This is exactly what Barbie does in the movie, and as a result, leaves her pink world to “fix her flaws”. But Barbie leaves behind her girly world with the aspiration of returning as an idealized version of herself, unlike girls in the real world.</p>

<p>Thus, triggering contemplation about why young girls often forsake not only their Barbie dolls but also the positive ideals linked with them. What happens to a girl to make her to relinquish something that once enriched her life?</p>

<p>Perhaps from the belief that shedding girlish aspects is necessary for being taken seriously. Perceiving these traits as "flaws" to be rectified might drive them to distance themselves from Barbie (even if I like playing with them), or pink (cause I’m not a dumb bimbo) and anything associated with perceived femininity.</p>

<p>This struggle resonates strongly with the current generation, as illustrated in the film when one of Sasha’s friends expresses her liking for Barbie, only to be met with disapproving glances from her peers.</p>

<p>Because liking Barbie equates to lacking depth.</p>
<h3>Exploration of Motherhood</h3>

<p>The exploration of motherhood emerges as one of the central and poignant themes in the movie. The intricate bond between Gloria and Sasha drives the plot at various points, while the mother-daughter relationship emblematic of Barbie and Ruth Handler—the visionary behind Barbie—adds a profound layer to Barbie’s own identity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We, mothers, stand still so our daughters can look back and see how far we have come.<br>- Ruth Handler (in the movie)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gloria's engagement with the Barbie doll takes on a deeper dimension; it becomes a conduit for her to create cherished memories with her daughter. The doll also becomes a canvas onto which Gloria projects her intricate emotions, acting as a bridge to navigate the emotional distance she feels from her daughter. It was Barbie that ultimately helped them connect, underscoring how seemingly ordinary objects can hold profound significance in bridging gaps and fostering connection.</p>

<p>The narrative surrounding Barbie's role in both individual childhoods and broader parenthood experiences echoes themes of memory, nostalgia, and the unifying thread of motherhood. As such, the film masterfully weaves the personal and universal aspects of motherhood, offering a poignant lens through which to reflect on the intricate ties that bind generations together.</p>
<h2>Inconsistencies in Concept</h2>

<p>As we unpack both the pink-hued fantasies of Barbieland and stark realities of the real world, we traverse a landscape of dichotomies.</p>

<p>That being said, one of the few things I’m grateful for is the fact that the movie doesn't shy away from self-deprecation when shedding light on the evolution of the Barbie brand.</p>

<p>With an unapologetic gaze, it showcases Mattel's past missteps in its efforts to adapt to modern sensibilities. These blunders span a range of eyebrow-raising creations, from the inflated-breast Skipper doll, pregnant Midge (what were they thinking!?), Barbie video girl (she had a screen attached to her back), a sugar daddy Ken, and all the dolls that were inevitably discontinued.</p>

<p>This candid exploration highlights the inherent inconsistencies that have long shadowed the Barbie concept.</p>

<p>After all, Barbie is a symbol of female liberation, but it can coexist as a product deeply entangled in the web of consumerism.</p>

<p>This duality is further accentuated by the movie's audacious jabs at Mattel executives and the brand itself, all of it that was approved by the company.</p>

<p>Yet, it's worth pondering whether these ostensibly self-deprecating gestures are more calculated than they appear. The substantial profits reaped from the movie's triumph and subsequent brand collaborations could transform these jabs from self-targeted humor to smart money-making strategies.</p>

<p>Marketing, inevitably, becomes a paramount topic when discussing the film. Its pervasive presence is hard to ignore, a testament to its power and reach.</p>

<p>All of this intoxicating pink consumerism invites backlash from critics who perceive the movie as more than just a cinematic experience, branding it as a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k8v94/a-live-action-barbie-movie-is-just-a-commercial-even-if-the-outfits-are-cute">flashy commercial</a> for Mattel.</p>

<p>They are, however, correct. In a way.</p>

<p>Amidst the playful taunting of the company within the film, Barbie the brand is separated from the business of the brand. Hence, further establishing the brand and embedding itself into the cultural psyche.</p>

<p>Yet, what truly captivates me is the movie’s profound immersion in its own intricate paradoxes.</p>

<p>Despite Barbie encouraging self-doubt and depicting distorted body images in young girls through the decades, the film’s core essence, underneath the “I’m just Ken” ballads, is acceptance, understanding, and liking who we are!</p>

<p>And that’s okay!</p>

<p>Because embracing art often means embracing paradox.</p>

<p>Often navigating intricate layers are intrinsic to the artistic journey.</p>

<p>And might I add that these enigmatic contradictions align seamlessly with a director known for her depth.</p>

<p>A director who had her Jo March declare: “I am so sick of people saying that love is just all a woman is fit for. I’m so sick of it! But – I am so lonely.”</p>

<p>In the labyrinth of paradoxes, the film invites us to embrace the complexity and embrace it we must, for it's through embracing such complexities that we unveil the genuine depth of our understanding, not only of the art on screen but also of the intricate fabric of existence itself.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There is so much that can be written about the concept of Barbie and its portrayal in the film. In this intricate void of views, "Barbie" emerges as a reflection of the paradoxes inherent in the human experience. Through its exploration of self-identity, societal norms, and the ever-changing nature of womanhood, it challenges us to reflect on our own roles in shaping the world around us.</p>

<p>It encourages us to embrace both the flaws and the triumphs that make us human, ultimately illuminating that beneath the surface lies a beautiful, complex tapestry of existence waiting to be explored, understood, and celebrated.</p>

<p>Barbie ultimately makes us realize what a great time it is to be a woman.</p>

<p>Thus, there cannot be a better sixteenth birthday present to me, other than the promise of just living life as a woman.</p>

<p>It took me over two weeks of evaluation that I ended up ultimately writing this article.</p>

<p>It is not every day that we realize that the impact of art is not always immediate, but gradual—a slow evolution that prompts introspection and reevaluation.</p>

<p>Just as Barbie's own transformation occurs over time, so does our perception of the film's messages.</p>

<p>Instant gratification does not make for masterpieces and memorable works of art, instead, their layers unfold as we contemplate, question, and discuss.</p>
