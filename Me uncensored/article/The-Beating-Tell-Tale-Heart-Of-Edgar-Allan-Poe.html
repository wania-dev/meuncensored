            <p>Ernst Lanzer is immortalised in psychological history as The Rat Man.</p>

<p>Lanzer's story, interwoven with persistent obsessive thoughts and irrational compulsions, not only captivated the attention of <a href=“ https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjfx_3g75iBAxX9RfEDHRQADtEQFnoECDEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.britannica.com%2Fbiography%2FSigmund-Freud&usg=AOvVaw3UAGhtVM_aiqvGl2RYnmiY&opi=89978449” target=“_blank”>Sigmund Freud</a> but also contributed to the development of Freud's <a href=“ https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjyu52N8JiBAxWxX_EDHRiJB1UQFnoECA4QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oxfordreference.com%2Fdisplay%2F10.1093%2Foi%2Fauthority.20110803100405455%23%3A~%3Atext%3DThe%2520Rat%2520Man%2520was%2520tormented%2CStandard%2520Edition%252C%2520X%252C%2520pp.&usg=AOvVaw2f8LJcfbJ8qdEEMcaLCApG&opi=89978449” target=“_blank”>groundbreaking theories in 1909</a></p>

<p>Lanzer, a Viennese native, pursued a conventional path, attending university and training as a lawyer. However, beneath his composed exterior lurked a psychological turmoil that would haunt him for years. It wasn’t until 1907 that Rat Man sought professional help.</p>

<p>What plagued the Rat Man were incessant, intrusive thoughts, seemingly emerging from the depths of his psyche with no apparent trigger. These thoughts were often dark and foreboding, typically centered around the misfortune that might befall a loved one. To end these relentless mental demons, he felt compelled to undertake peculiar and irrational actions e.g. slashing his own throat. Freud later discovered that at the heart of Rat Man's torment lay a singular fixation—an irrational fear of his father's death.</p>

<p>But did you know there exists a curious figure, an enigmatic narrator whose obsessions and tormented thoughts have been similarly dissected, analysed, and puzzled over for generations. But before we delve into the depths of this character's psyche, let's rewind the clock, journeying back approximately 66 years to an era when the concept of psychoanalysis was yet to be conceived.</p>

<p>It was the era of the dark and masterful wordsmith, <a href=“ https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjIgKys8JiBAxVHVfEDHTDwDn4QFnoECGIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.britannica.com%2Fbiography%2FEdgar-Allan-Poe&usg=AOvVaw19SVvQ0jBtfhLXk4wXDNay&opi=89978449” target=“_blank”>Edgar Allan Poe</a>.</p>

<p>Without the benefit of modern psychoanalysis, Poe's writings allowed the earliest generations of psychiatrists to venture into their patients' minds, seeking answers and solutions to the intricate tapestries of human consciousness.</p>

<p>Poe constructed a man, his senses sharpened to an almost supernatural level (or that he thinks), who is driven to the brink of madness by a relentless, pounding sound—the beating of a heart.</p>

<p>But this heart is not his own; it's the heart of the old man whom he’s just killed!</p>

<p>Did he murder because he was mad, or did he become mad after the murder when the guilt consumed him?</p>

<p>After all, people kill for all reasons: some nobler than others. But that doesn’t automatically categorise them as mad, does it? Except only when the killer kills the victim after having been made uneasy by his eye!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, have you ever felt the relentless, pounding beat of a heart that refuses to be ignored, even in the darkest corners of your mind?</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll be introducing the world of Edgar Allan Poe, more specifically his shortest short story, <a href=“https://poemuseum.org/the-tell-tale-heart/“ target=“_blank”>"The Tell Tale Heart”</a>, a tale that despite it’s word limitations captures precisely the twisted psyche of its narrator, revealing layers of obsession, detachment, and the thin line between sanity and madness.</p>

<p>At the outset of the story, the narrator proclaims, "I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell." It's an eccentric assertion, hinting at a mind not entirely in touch with reality.</p>

<p>Throughout the story, the narrator vehemently argues against his own madness, yet paradoxically, every argument he presents only serves to underscore his descent into insanity. As the narrative unfolds, it becomes clear that this is not just another tale of madness; it's a unique exploration of cunning and genius, making the narrator unlike any conventional madman. His claim that "The disease had sharpened my senses — not destroyed — not dulled them", adds an unsettling layer to his character.</p>

<p>In a brilliantly ironic twist, the narrator uses his calm demeanor as proof of his sanity, stating, "Hearken! and observe how healthily — how calmly I can tell you the whole story." This is a classic case of appearance versus reality, just because the sea is calm at the surface doesn't mean a storm isn't brewing beneath. I wish the narrator realised appearing calm and collected while narrating a brutish crime isn’t a wise decision if you have any wish to get away with it.</p>

<p>The narrator's motivations behind the murder are equally enigmatic. He admits, "It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night." This gradual degeneration into obsession defines the core of the story.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the relationship between the narrator and the victim (an old man) is ambiguous; we're left to wonder whether they are neighbors or if the narrator is the caregiver.</p>

<p>What we do know is that the narrator loves him and has no real motivation to kill him other than a psychotic fixation on the old man’s eye.</p>

<p>He does not wish to harm the old man, just “rid [himself] of the eye forever”. Yet, he fails to recognize that the eye is an inherent part of the old man's identity, not a separate entity to be isolated: “for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye”. If he hurt the eye, he’d the hurt the person he loves.</p>

<p>Poe here explores a psychological dilemma fifty years before Freud made it a leading concept in his theories of the mind: the paradox of harming those we love or need.</p>

<p>In contrast, maybe the narrator didn’t love the old man. Maybe he’s just devoid of all emotion (“Passion there was none”). Maybe the fact that he killed his victim only because his eye made him uneasy is testament enough of his lack of empathy and emotion.</p>

<p>The narrator's claim that "Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me" underscores his arrogance as he distinguishes himself from conventional madmen. He believes he's wise, not mad, and even hopes to prove his objectivity by describing his horrific deed. This once again highlights the theme of appearance versus reality.</p>

<p>“So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.” In executing the gruesome act, the narrator inhabits multiple personalities. He stalks the victim like an intelligent executioner, terrorizes his prey like a cruel predator, and narrates the whole incident like a master storyteller. Furthermore, the narrator confuses intelligence with wisdom and sanity throughout the story, revealing the capacity of the human mind to deceive itself.</p>

<p>After stalking his victim for seven consecutive nights, the action of the story takes place. The scene of the crime takes place in a closed system, the old man's pitch-black bedroom, with shutters tightly closed to ward off uninvited visitors. (“His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,…”). The situational irony being: the very thing that’s meant to protect the old man becomes the instrument of his demise.</p>

<p>Adding another layer of chilling elements is the narrator's glee in realizing the old man's vulnerability: "I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts." The victim remains consciously unaware, yet deeply terrified, with no savior in sight. The narrator's meticulous planning and execution further emphasize his calculating nature.</p>

<p>The victim's increasing sense of impending doom, as captured in phrases like "His fears had been ever since growing upon him," reveals itself through moans that echo from the depths of his soul, "low stifled sounds that arose from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe."</p>

<p>The narrator projects his own demons onto the old man, subjecting him to the same nighttime torment he endures, “I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me.” Thus, portraying the depths of the narrator's madness.</p>

<p>The heartbeats become central as the narrative progresses, with the line between the old man's heart and the narrator's own blurring. The heart's rhythmic cadence symbolizes the impending doom, escalating the tension until the climax arrives</p>

<p>In the story, the notion that "Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim" is a thought-provoking concept. It evokes a sense of wielding immense destructive power, reminiscent of the famous quote, "Now I have become death, the destroyer of the worlds." This idea underscores the idea that having such overwhelming power in a fleeting moment can lead the mind to a god-like state.</p>

<p>As the narrator stands on the precipice of murdering the old man, it's not a sense of humanity that drives him, but rather the relentless thud of the old man's heart: “It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.” This beating heart serves as a dark motivator, intensifying his fury akin to the way the rhythmic drumbeats embolden a soldier for battle.</p>

<p>This situation also poses a disturbing moral paradox. The act of a soldier, killing innocent individuals who have done them no harm, and the psychopath's actions in this story, murdering an innocent man without provocation, share a chilling similarity. Both involve the taking of innocent lives. Yet, society often categorizes the former as heroic, while condemning the latter as villainous due to legality. This contradiction underscores the complex interplay of morality, legality, and societal norms.</p>

<p>The deliberate terror inflicted upon the victim before the final act reveals the narrator's sadistic tendencies, adding another layer to his character's unsettling nature. In this moment, the question arises: Whose heart is it that truly beats with dread and terror—the old man's, or the narrator's?</p>

<p>The police's arrival, prompted by a neighbor's report of a shriek, introduces a twist to the plot. The narrator's arrogance and calm demeanor (including the his invitation to the officers to “search-search well”) are, in fact, manifestations of his guilt and underlying desire to be caught.</p>

<p>In the harrowing climax of the story, the narrator's confession becomes the pivotal moment, driven by his desperate attempt to drown out the relentless thumping of the beating heart.</p>

<p>The unfaltering beating becomes a maddening presence, echoing in his ears, and he unconsciously begins to grapple with the weight of his actions.</p>

<p>In a chilling proclamation, he utters the words, "it is the beating of his hideous heart," laying bare the true horror of the narrative. What once compelled him to commit murder now leads to his undoing, as guilt and madness converge, culminating in his involuntary confession.</p>

<p>It's in this moment that we witness the narrator's true form, stripped of his facade of cold rationality.</p>

<p>The narrator's mounting paranoia and guilt inexorably push him toward self-betrayal. When the police arrived, they unwittingly offer him the chance to expose himself. The more he asserts his composure, the more he becomes ensnared by the relentless pounding of his own heart, mistakenly attributing it to the old man's heartbeats that are so loud that the narrator suspects the police pretending to not hear it in order to mock him. “Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! — and now — again! — hark! louder! louder!” His final words, addressing the policemen as "[v]illains," underscore his inability to distinguish their true identity from his own growing sense of villainy.</p>

<p>In this way, the story's climax is an exploration of the blurred lines between sanity and madness, guilt and innocence, and reality and delusion.</p>

<p>After reading the story multiple times, I contemplated the boundaries of sanity, the enigmatic nature of obsession, and the elusive distinction between appearance and reality, and a particular question gnawed at my mind: what is the difference between obsession and passion. After all, the two are often synonymous. What truly sets them apart?</p>

<p>If passion is blind, is obsession it’s equally blind counterpart?</p>

<p>If passion is related to emotions, is obsession the lack of it as personified by the manic narrator who “feels no passion”? Does being obsessed towards one thing mean being emotionally detached from everything else?</p>

<p>If so then have there been moments in my own life where I’ve felt emotionally detached or disconnected from others, as the narrator did towards the old man, while pursuing one thing that has dominated my thoughts and actions, without any real motivation?</p>

<p>The answer is… yeah. There have been moments in my life when I've allowed a single pursuit to dominate my life, seemingly without any true motivation. Like those days when I’m buried in textbooks, determined to achieve a perfect score, or the days spent coding a project I’m inexplicably 'passionate' about (Exhibit A: this very blog), or whenever I pick up a book and become so obsessed by it that I can only let go once I’ve read it thrice, analysed it twice, and have had a meaningful discussion about it at-least once (Exhibit B: this very article). These, as I call them, ‘time blocks’ often lead me to disconnect from family, friends, and the world around me. But I always attribute my ‘focus’, whilst working, to my perfectionism. But why do I do them? Is it pure passion or have I unwittingly crossed into the realm of obsession?</p>

<p>I realize that I am a bit of both. While I certainly have a genuine interest in these pursuits, there comes a point at which my determination morphs into something more relentless. Now I can’t help but wonder what are the consequences of allowing obsessions to consume our lives? And more importantly, how do i know if I’m passionate or obsessed?</p>

<p>Im going to try my best to answer this question. I acknowledge the fact that my obsessions, unlike the narrator’s fixation in the old man’s eye, were primarily internal. They didn't involve harming others or veer into the realm of self-destruction like the Rat Man. They were centered on my own goals and desires, rooted in a logical pursuit of excellence.</p>

<p>Hence, it’s all within the realm of my inner world. So maybe the delicate line between passion and obsession is crossed when that determination, the singular obsessive focus, extends beyond that realm. The point where tunnel vision becomes a tunnel pointing towards someone else’s vision (like the single ray on the old man’s eye?).</p>

<p>I think it all lies in recognizing when this shift occurs and striving for a healthier equilibrium between our passions and the obsessions that may lurk just beneath the surface of our pursuits.</p>

<p><b>In what ways do we deceive ourselves about our own actions or beliefs, similar to the narrator's self-deception regarding his sanity?</b></p>

<p>The haunting narrative of "The Tell-Tale Heart" raises a profound question about self-deception, something that many of us grapple with in our own lives. The narrator's relentless insistence that he is not mad, even as he commits a heinous act, forces us to confront the idea that we, too, might sometimes deceive ourselves. How often do we rationalize our actions, convincing ourselves that we are making the right choices even when evidence suggests otherwise? Whether it's ignoring the unhealthy aspects of a relationship or convincing ourselves that our workaholic tendencies are purely driven by passion (I’m self-reflecting again), we often construct narratives that shield us from uncomfortable truths. Recognizing these self-deceptions is the first step towards greater self-awareness and the ability to make more informed decisions.</p>

<p>In my case, maybe something else lurks beneath my pursuits. Maybe I work as hard as I do because I want to be perfect. Because if I’m imperfect, people won’t like me. Consequently, the pursuit of perfectionism is exhausting. It’s the same paradox I discussed when i analyzed <a href=“ https://meuncensored.vercel.app/article/Unboxing-barbie-a-personal-reflection.html” target=“_blank”>The Barbie Movie</a>. How our nervousness, social anxiety, or irrational actions stems from our deep, desperate desire to be loved. In my case, the actions are not irrational, the intentions that fuel those actions are as flawed as the concept of perfectionism.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the question we all must ask ourselves at the end of the day is how can we distinguish between reality and the stories we tell ourselves?</p>

<p>In conclusion, this tale serves as a timeless reminder that sometimes the greatest horror lies within the recesses of our own minds, waiting to be unleashed. The narrator's journey from eccentricity to insanity is a haunting exploration of the human psyche, a narrative that continues to captivate and disturb readers since its publication in January 1843. Poe's masterful storytelling reminds us that the beating of our own hearts can be the most terrifying sound of all.</p>
