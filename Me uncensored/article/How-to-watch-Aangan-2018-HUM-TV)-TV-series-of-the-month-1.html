        <article class="article">
            <p>It was a chilly winter's eve in 2018, a young girl found herself seeking refuge in her grandma's room, hoping to go unnoticed. She was determined not to attract any attention when the countdown timer hit zero on the TV screen.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, her invisibility trick worked that day, and she had the chance to witness the opening credits of a gripping drama—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aangan_(2018_TV_series)" target="_blank">Aangan</a>.</p>

<p>A little thrill almost escaped her throat when the opening credits rolled, but she stopped it just in time.</p>

<p>The catchy theme song kicked in...<br>
<i>Hari hari mein hari… maan aagan pe ishq hai taari</i></p>

<p>Enter: Chammi</p>

<p>The girl was obsessed with Chammi, a character played flawlessly by the talented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajal_Aly" target="_blank">Sajal Aly</a>. Chammi was a firecracker—a free-spirited rebel who fearlessly spoke her mind (‘Hum Na He Dil Na He Jaan Mangte Hain.’).</p>

<p>Someone who loved with unapologetic passion (‘Daikhiya kis husn say poshida gham ka raaz hay… teer meray dil mai hay parday mai teer andaaz hay.’).</p>

<p>Her fierce and nonconventional political outspokenness made her absolutely mesmerizing (‘Is ghar main saare congressi nahi rehte.. Muslim League Zindabad!’).</p>

<p>All of these qualities are still quite as impressive to the little girl as they were then, except a few things have changed. The little girl is not so little anymore.</p>

<p>She has grown a little, matured a little, gone places, have had experiences. Some of those experiences have led her to write this article.</p>

<p>Now Chammi has changed. For me. Although she still remains to be one of the most cinematic, authentic, and timeless characters ever written in the history of Pakistani literature (although, I’m not sure that says a lot about the industry), this mature girl seems to have an opinion that Chammi might be a little less… mature.</p>

<p>Okay. Chammi is immature. Selfish. Imprudent. Sue. Me.</p>

<p>Eventually, that led to her own downfall. I mean, sure, she got what she always yearned for. Jameel.</p>

<p>Jameel, a jobless poet who invaded his cousin's personal space and pulled all sorts of manipulative moves. Jameel, someone who reacted outlandishly when he couldn't handle rejection. But really, was the whole drama worth it?</p>

<p>Looking back, I realize I fell into the trap of romanticizing Jameel too, as did almost the entire world back then. The media portrayed him as a dreamy, poetic soul, lost in love and I bought into it. But now, with my eyes wide open, I see that it was nothing but abuse and gross misuse of power. Classic patriarchal nonsense, even in the supposedly matriarchal haveli.</p>

<p>And you know what? I'm grateful to Aangan for shedding light on this toxic behavior. Jameel's character serves as a reminder of those times when men felt entitled to invade a girl's room in the middle of the night, forcing their expressions of love and expecting unquestioning devotion and being frustrated and manhandle-y if she doesn’t reciprocate. His frustration and anger were nothing but entitled arrogance. And believe me, I couldn't be more thankful for such an authentic portrayal.</p>

<p>Enter Aliya. She's the real deal—a force to be reckoned with. Traumatized by her sister Tehmina's tragic suicide, Aliya stopped believing in love. She ditched the fairy tale fantasies and decided to focus on one thing: financial independence so she and her mother can take care of themselves and not wait for the men in the family (or a family with men like Jameel) to come to their rescue. Even in the '40s, Aliya knew she had the power to create her own destiny.</p>

<p>Aliya's character brought a breath of fresh air to the drama. She was practical, determined, and far from being a damsel in distress. Her story resonated with me on a whole new level.</p>

<p>Yet, one of the most captivating aspects of Angan lies in its uncanny resemblance between the society portrayed eighty years ago and present-day Pakistan. The striking parallels are so remarkable that one could easily mistake Angan for a contemporary drama airing on TV today. It's a realization that leaves us questioning whether we have truly progressed at all. The reflection might even be repulsive, but we cannot deny that it reflects the society we live in right now.</p>

<p>When you take a step back and observe, it becomes apparent that the core issues that plagued society then persist today. From the infrastructure that still falls short to the social validation tied to fluent English-speaking skills over native Urdu, we find ourselves immersed in a familiar world. The improper conduct within families, verbal abuse, deep-rooted patriarchy, and the conflicting political opinions that simmer beneath the surface—all of it serves as a stark reminder of the present-day society we inhabit as a direct result of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/British-raj" target="_blank">British colonialism</a>.</p>

<p>As we immerse ourselves in the world of the haveli in the '40s, we are confronted with the undeniable truth that while times may have changed, the essence of our society remains disconcertingly familiar.</p>

<p>The drama's ability to reflect on our present reality is a testament to the power of storytelling and its capacity to shed light on our collective struggles especially ones endured during partition.</p>

<p>In a way, Aangan serves as a time capsule, offering a window into the past and insights into the present, and not only encouraging us to critically examine the progress we have made as a society or lack thereof but also proves to be an irresistible rollercoaster ride that guarantees hours of pure entertainment, making it a must-watch for anyone seeking a captivating and binge-worthy drama experience.</p>
