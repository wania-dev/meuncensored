            <p>As I type this article away, my shoulders move constantly to the groove of <i>Sheila ki Jawani</i>.</p> 

<p>As a child, I was never allowed to see the music video, and the few times I did, it was accompanied by my mother's lectures on the perceived immorality associated with such songs. Every <i>Sheila ki Jawani</i> visual came with a monologue about <i>jahannumi aurtein aur unke kaam.</i> </p>

<p>Growing up, I too viewed "item" songs as a problematic threat, perpetuating the objectification of women. These songs often featured scantily clad dancers, lip-syncing suggestive lyrics while dancing amidst a crowd of exaggeratedly ogling men. </p>

<p>It always seemed like what it was: a cheap marketing tactic employed by filmmakers to sell movie tickets. Yet, the success of a film was rarely attributed to its "item" songs, despite their prominent inclusion.</p> 

<p>If a character's sensuality is essential to the plot, then it can be justified. However, as we all know, most "item numbers" fail to meet that criterion.</p>

<p>And don't get me wrong, my intention is not to impose moral judgments. </p>

<p>What really troubled me was the reduction of both the performers and women in general to mere sexual objects. The entire existence and production process of "item" songs depends on the sexualization of the dancers, often without contributing to the overall storyline. </p>

<p>As a young girl, I found it perplexing that movies would interrupt their narratives to break into provocative dance sequences featuring women, while such objectification of men rarely occurred. This discrepancy reflects the prevalent practice of employing female characters primarily as arm candy, with their own side plots being secondary to the hero's story.</p>

<p>Cut to this one particular day, there was a crisis. A twenty-something female relative was frustrated as she was stressed over her single relationship status. </p>

<p>In her state of desperation, it seemed like she would have accepted anyone, regardless of their age or appearance. Like, ANYBODY! </p>

<p>It was confusing for me how a girl who used to be so precise and succinct in the man of her choice would readily agree to a middle-aged office goon who's visibly balding. Coincidentally the next random song that started playing on Spotify was none other than...  </p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">" I know you want it but you never gonna get it <br>
Tere haath kabhi na aani<br>
Maane na maane koi duniya yeh saari<br>
Mere ishq ki hai deewani<br>
Ab dil karta hai huale haule see<br>
Main toh khud ko gale lagaun<br>
Kisi aur ki mujhko zaroorat kya<br>
Main toh khud se pyar jataun "</p>

<p>At that moment, I wished every girl could have an attitude like Sheila, confidently and proudly expressing those words. </p>

<p>It made me reconsider the whole conversation surrounding "item" songs.  </p>

<p>I'm not gonna make the mistake to take a definitive side on the matter as opinions are often conflicted. </p>

<p>Some argue that item songs symbolize the objectification and sexualization of women through the male gaze, perpetuating harmful beauty stereotypes, morally corrupting society, or are mere money-making tactics (as listed earlier). Which is true in some cases.</p>

<p>While on the other hand, they are viewed as a means for women to express their suppressed sexualities and live vicariously through Sheila and Munni, the suggestive wordings end up as a symbol of liberation and feminism. True too.</p>

<p>But they can't possibly do both at the same time, can they? So which one is it?</p>

<p>Both arguments hold validity, depending on the specific "item" song being discussed. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the visuals accompanying these songs often reinforce objectification, regardless of empowering lyrics. </p>

<p>While some performers themselves, along with a segment of their female audience, perceive item songs as a personal choice that empowers women—a sentiment that Mehwish Hayat has endorsed repeatedly—others find them derogatory and demeaning. </p>

<p>However, this does not imply that a middle ground cannot be found between the two parties. Some item songs may perpetuate objectification and reinforce harmful stereotypes, while others may empower performers and provide a platform for self-expression. By understanding the context, intent, and execution of each song, we can assess its impact and potentially discover that we might be on the same page after all.  </p>

<p>Respecting individual agency and allowing performers to make their own choices can coexist with concerns about the broader systemic issues of objectification and limited roles for women. </p>

<p>Beauty is, after all, in the eye of the beholder. </p>

<p>Because let's face it: when it comes to media, any media, be it films, songs, or books, perception is everything.</p>

<p>A filmmaker's choice directly shapes the perception and impact of their work.</p>

<p>Consider, for instance, that if <em>Sheila ki Jawani</em> had been created by a modern progressive woman with a compelling storyline that can walk on its own two feet without the lure of "item" numbers to attract more audiences, it could have been approached with more substantial storytelling and artistic vision, resulting in a less objectifying and more meaningful portrayal of a strong and sassy woman who knows her worth. </p>

<p>Such changes would not intend to reduce the sexy aspect, but rather to make the performance more sensible and less ridiculous. </p>

<p>And this goes without saying, zero-gawping men.</p>

<p>The term "objectification" has been recurring throughout this article, but what truly piques my curiosity is how "item" songs tend to accomplish this objectification. While we are aware of the basic elements like the dancing and lyrics, I believe the real issue lies in the lack of any other context provided for the "item girl." Throughout the duration of the movie, she is predominantly seen only within the confines of the song. This aspect is often overlooked, but I consider it to be the underlying cause of the sexualization associated with these sequences. </p>

<p>It underscores the importance of offering additional dimensions to the "item girl", beyond just her dancing skills, in order to humanize her and counteract the objectifying effect. </p>

<p><em><b>If the inclusion of an item song serves a purpose in enhancing the story, character development, or thematic elements, it can be seen as a legitimate creative choice. However, this should be balanced with avoiding unnecessary or gratuitous objectification.</b></em></p>

<p>It is no secret that item numbers are openly condemned by Pakistani audiences and celebrities alike. There are only a few celebrities who think that an "item" number could be someone’s vision and their portrayal of art, therefore it is perfectly fine if anyone wants to add such a song to their movie. while others might not see eye to eye with that idea.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure. The term "item number" itself is widely disputed as it inherently objectifies women, labeling them as mere commodities even before the performance begins. For those of you who don't know, a "hot girl" is typically referred to as an "item" in India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>What item songs ensure is the <em>systemic</em> objectification of women. It originates from the filmmakers themselves and the demand from the audience.</p>

<p>The problem lies in what that <i>represents</i>. It suggests that any girl aspiring to make it in Bollywood or the film industry, in general, has to become comfortable with dancing to item songs, even if she doesn't want to, and conform to a specific body type to be noticed. </p>

<p>While some of these professional women may not have an issue with this, many do. And that's more than acceptable because when one aspires to become an actress, they are not signing up solely for dancing. Acting and dancing are distinct professions. </p>

<p>This issue also draws attention to another problem, the scarcity of substantial female roles in the industry. Stories that revolve around women, such as Gangubai Kathiawadi, Qala, Mrs. Chatterjee vs Norway, The Fame Game, and more, are few and far between. </p>

<p>Consequently, aspiring young actresses often have to settle for shallow scripts and roles that frequently include a sexy item number.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Bollywood is making huge strides in that direction than the Pakistani Film Industry when it comes to evolved storylines.</p>

<p>In the end, there is no black-and-white way to judge or criticize or think about "item" numbers. I think they remain and probably will remain in the grey area for some time.  Filmmakers can strive to create more diverse and inclusive narratives that go beyond the traditional hero-villain-arm candy formula.</p>

<p>One of the ways we can accomplish this is by providing platforms and opportunities for female writers, directors, and producers to create content that challenges traditional norms and can lead to more authentic and nuanced portrayals of women in cinema, providing opportunities for actresses to showcase their talent beyond just dancing. </p> 

<p>Increasing the presence of women in key decision-making roles within the industry can contribute to a shift in perspectives and the inclusion of these diverse narratives.</p>

<p>We need a revival of movies that breaks the traditional movie landscape in terms of script, direction, and production values because, with the right context and perspective, even an "item number" (though I do hope we eliminate the use of that term) would not raise any red flags among feminist or conservative communities if they align with the values of changing times where women, in addition to being sexy and in control, want to see more of themselves as notorious gangsters, geniuses and goons, and maybe a little less as a skinny circus dancer desirable to a group of creepy men. </p>

<p>By integrating songs and dance sequences in a way that aligns with the narrative can also help filmmakers avoid the perception that item songs are mere marketing tactics or distractions from the main plot. </p>

<p>And there you have it, folks!</p>
<p> Sheila ki Jawani, the ultimate groovy track that made even my mom question her <em>jahannumi aurtein</em> lectures. May Sheila's infectious beats continue to make us unleash our inner divas, and give us the confidence to rock any dance floor, even if our moves are more like Sheila ki Jawa-ni-ni! 🎶💃😄</p>
